# github-example
This repository is a demonstration of how to create a Github repository and properly set it up
This is the second repository I created following the guidance presented in https://medium.com/@aklson_DS/how-to-properly-setup-your-github-repository-windows-version-ea596b398b
Hopefully I will catch up soon to be able to creat and share more code with others!
